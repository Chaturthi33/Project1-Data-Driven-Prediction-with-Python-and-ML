# Project1-Data-Driven-Prediction-with-Python-and-ML

## Project Overview
##### This project applies Machine Learning techniques to a realistic Kralijic dataset, which simulates supply chain data for applying the Kraljic Matrix framework. The goal is to classify items into four categories (e.g., Leverage, Strategic, Non-Critical, Bottleneck) amd evaluate the performance of the model .
